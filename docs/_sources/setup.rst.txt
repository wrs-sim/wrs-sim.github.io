Simulation Environment Setup
============================


Competition Network Setup
-------------------------

    Robot simulation will be performed on computers provided by the organizers
        The specs of the organizer's computer: https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0BTM9SYSX?language=en_US

    Please obtain the simulation results via network communication and operate the robots on your own computers. The computers provided by the organizers will serve as servers, and the computers provided by the competitors will serve as clients.
        The mobile robot is in a simulation on the organizer's computers and connected to the competitor's computers via the network. This relationship is similar to a real mobile robot connected to a host computers via a network. If a team wishes to use its unique robot or functions in the match, it will submit the robot model and program to the organizers, who will implement it on the competition simulation computers.

    Note: Do not use Wi-Fi communication while using this connection method. Choreonoid simulation will slow down while Wi-Fi communication is in use.


To process Choreonoid on a Nvidia GPU


[MANDATORY] Graphics Card Configuration
---------------------------------------

To process Choreonoid with an Nvidia GPU, change the settings as follows:

 1. Select Prime Profiles in "NVIDIA settings".
 2. For "Select the GPU you would like to use", select "NVIDIA (Performance Mode)"
 3. When you launch Choreonoid, if "Driver Profile: NVIDIA Corporation XX" displays as shown below, Choreonoid will use the NVIDIA GPU.

**If you are running on a laptop, please run the Choreonoid simulation while it is connected to a power source. If it is not connected, the simulation will run slowly.**
